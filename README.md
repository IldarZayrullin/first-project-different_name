# This is my first project

## I've started to learn how to use GitHub

**1. How it cans help me?**
	_It is important to control versions_
	_I can use other devices and stay up-to-date
**2. How I can help myself?**
	_Firstly, I have to stay on track and do my research_
	_I may spend more time, just deny somethings is not so important_
**Just for case:**
'''mkdir my_project
cd my_project
git init
'''
